# Passwort-Generator

This is a simple password generator GUI application built using Python and the tkinter library. It generates a random password consisting of lower-case and upper-case letters, numbers, and symbols, and provides options to copy the generated password to the clipboard or save it to a file along with a username.

Installation
To run this program, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You'll also need to have the tkinter library installed. If you're using Python 3.1 or later, tkinter is included in the standard library. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you'll need to install tkinter separately. You can install it using pip, the Python package installer:

pip install tkinter

How to use
To use the password generator, simply run the script password_generator.py. This will open a GUI window where you can generate a new password, copy it to the clipboard, or save it to a file.

Generating a password
To generate a new password, click the "Generate Password" button. The generated password will be displayed in the text box next to the "Generated Password" label.

Copying a password to the clipboard
To copy the generated password to the clipboard, click the "Copy to Clipboard" button. This will copy the password to the clipboard, so you can paste it into another application.

Saving a password
To save the generated password along with a username, click the "Save Password" button. This will prompt you to enter a username and choose a file location to save the password to. If the file to store the passwords doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
